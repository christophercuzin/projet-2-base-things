projet-2-base-things
this project is a dynamic website that targets base jumpers and allows them to have access to a database, in which a certain number of jump points are entered, for each of these jumps we have information such as the place where they are, the gps coordinates, the most regularly used equipment and other useful information. it also allows them to have access to a jump book in which they can enter a jump they have made among those existing in the database. This is the second project I've been involved in.
